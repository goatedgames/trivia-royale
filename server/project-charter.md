# Trivia Royale
## Project Charter
May 29, 2019

## Project Statement
We will be extending our CodeDay project, Trivia Royale. Trivia Royale is a battle royale game that uses trivia instead of traditional game mechanics. For this project, we will be updating the game by adding more functionality, such as a cleaner UI and additional game mechanics.

## Concise Project Overview
The duration of the project is three weeks. THe budget is $0 for development, and up to $10 for hosting the game servers on AWS. We will not need any approvals, as we are developing the game from scratch as our own passion project. The stakeholders are ourselves, as we set the expectations for the game. The major constraints are time and learning skill, as we will need to quickly learn some new libraries like React to expand on Trivia Royale. Some risks are not finishing the update, failing to comprehend the complexity of new libraries, and potential compatibility issues due to differences in user platforms.

## Scope Statement
One of our goals is to create a UI which is aethetically pleasing. We can evaluate this by having other students test our game and observing their playing flow and implementing changges depending on their feedback. Another goal is to add beneficial game mechanics. This involves expanding on our lives system and implementing power-ups. We evaluate this by qualitatively judging the depth of the mechanics by ourselves and through student feedback. Another goal is to implement multiple games simultaneously. This is a fairly straightforward one to track--if we have more than 2 or 3 games going on at once.

## Stakeholders
Stakeholders are ourselves. We will have conversations with ourselves and learn React, Node, possibility Typescript, and more CSS to build our project from the ground up.

## Timeline

## Budget Estimates
* Computers and software: $0
* AWS server or similar hosting: $10

## Risks and Contingency Plans
* Risks: Convuluted code structure resulting in unmaintainable code, server downtime
* Contingency: we have base functionality from the CodeDay project
